## Project Overview
Developed a stock price forecaster using dual linear regression models to predict future stock prices. The project involved extensive data analysis and preprocessing using Python, Sci-kit Learn, and Pandas.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Sci-kit Learn
- Pandas

## Example
Here is the model run on the ticker $SOXL, where linear regression 1 is modelling the short term movement of 100 trading days and linear regression 2 is modelling the past 400 days before.
